# Changelog

## [Unreleased] — Phase 3 scaffold (2026-04-23)

### Added
- Initial repo scaffold: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, two packs (`analysis-pack`, `productivity-pack`) with standard `plugin.json`.
- `plugins/productivity-pack/.claude-plugin/recommends.json` with the `codex` external dependency.
- `LICENSE` (MIT), `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` (placeholder values filled in Phase 4).
- `docs/`: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `RECOMMENDED_PLUGINS.md`, `MASTER_PLAN_v1.5.md`, Phase 1 catalog, Phase 2 selection.
- `.gitignore` covering `.env`, `dist/`, personal notes/archives.

### Notes
- `game-design-pack` is deferred (MASTER_PLAN §2.3.1 gate: vendored 0 + new-authored 1 < 2). Not registered in `marketplace.json`.
- Vendored content lands in Phase 4. Self-authored workflows in Phase 5.
- `/productivity-pack:check-recommended` command is planned for Phase 5.
